YADM-GIT.VIM                                       *yadm-git.vim-yadm-git.vim*

Integrates `yadm` <https://github.com/TheLocehiliosan/yadm> with `vim-fugitive`
<https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive> and `vim-gitgutter`
<https://github.com/airblade/vim-gitgutter> so you can manage your dotfiles
without leaving vim.

Whenever a buffer is loaded, uses `yadm ls-files` to detect if the current file
is tracked by `yadm`. If it is, this:

- runs `FugitiveDetect` from `vim-fugitive` <https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive>, so fugitive can act on the `yadm` git repo. All fugitive bindings stay the same
- sets `g:gitgutter_git_executable` to `yadm`, which causes `vim-gitgutter` <https://github.com/airblade/vim-gitgutter> to show changed git hunks using `yadm`

When you stop editing the dotfile (switch to a file which `yadm` isn’t
tracking), it resets them back to the defaults (Fugitive does that
automatically).

For gitgutter, you might prefer to switch to gitsigns
<https://github.com/lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim>, which provides yadm support out
of the box


INSTALL                                                 *yadm-git.vim-install*

This uses |`jobstart`|, so it requires `neovim`. Am quite new to writing
plugins, so would appreciate feedback and/or contributions for compatibility
with vim

Should work with all vim plugin managers – load the file in `plugin`

For example, using `lazy` <https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim>

>lua
    {
        'seanbreckenridge/yadm-git.vim',
        event = "BufWinEnter",
        config = function()
            vim.g.yadm_git_gitgutter_enabled = 0 -- I use gitsigns instead
        end
    }
<

Configuration:

>vim
    let g:yadm_git_enabled = 1 " setting this to 0 disables the plugin
    let g:yadm_git_verbose = 0 " prints when it yadm ls-files detects a file
    
    let g:yadm_git_fugitive_enabled = 1
    let g:yadm_git_gitgutter_enabled = 1
    
    " the location of your yadm repo (this is the default for yadm)
    " used with FugitiveDetect when it detects a dotfile
    let g:yadm_git_repo_path = "~/.local/share/yadm/repo.git"
    " to 'reset' gitgutter git path after switching buffers
    " to a non-dotfile. you probably dont need to set this
    let g:yadm_git_default_git_path = "git"

KNOWNISSUES ~

Sometimes when switching back to a git repository from a dotfile, GitGutter
doesn’t redraw the hunks. This can be fixed by running `:GitGutter` to force
a redraw
